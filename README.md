## Analysis of Top 50 Songs

### Top Songs That Never Reached Number 1

Observing the data, I was curious of which songs in the top 50 never made it to the number one position.

The most recently released song from the top 10 in this category was released nearly 3 years ago. This allowed me to conclude that this song and those in similar position are being preserved by fans or may have regained popularity but have missed their window to reach the number one position. 

### Newest Songs In The Top 50

I was also curious about which songs have cracked the top 50 in the shortest amount of time since being released.

## Summary

In closing, I was able to uncover a few interesting points. It takes some time to make it to the top of this list. Many of the most popular artists and songs that we currently know may not be on this list for another year or two. This also gave me even more insight into the power of longtime fans that help to preserve the position of many of the older songs on the list.
